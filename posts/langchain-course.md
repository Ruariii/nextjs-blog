I have started the **Learn Langchain** course on Scrimba as part of my ongoing development as a software engineer!

Langchain is a JavaScript framework for creating web-based applications that use large language models (LLMs), and can be used for creating chatbots, document analysis or code analysis. My aim is to create a web-based document analysis tool that could assist our regulatory team in analysis medical device regulatory standards.
