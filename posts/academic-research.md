**I have been involved in academic research at Salford University!**

'Biostrain' is an isometric strength assessment platform that simulates the flight phase of running gait. I have been involved in the development of 'Biostrain' in my role at Lucid Innovation. My work has included the development of an 'auto-setup' algorithm that generates a combination of adjustment settings for a given user height and desired position.

The 'Biostrain' device has recently been involved in academic research at the university of Salford. I have been involved in the study as a techincal consultant, helping with data collection and providing software support.

I am excited to see the results!
