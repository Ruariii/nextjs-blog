I am thrilled to announce that I have achieved a first class (with honours) master's degree in Aeronautical and Aerospace engineering from the University of Leeds. Below are some personal highlights from my 4 year journey:

**Final year project:**

My final year project 'Aerodynamic analysis of a forward-swept crescent wing concept' was an opportunity for me to showcase all the skills and technical knowledge I have learned in my time at Leeds. I used CFD software VFP to perform 3D analysis of a forward swept wing, in order to optimise the novel crescent planform for transonic flight conditions.

**In-flight data collection at Cranfield:**

As part of the 'Flight Mechanics' module in third year, we got the opportunity to experience a number of aircraft manoeuvres first hand in the National Flying Laboratory Centreâ€™s (NFLC) light aircraft at Cranfield University.

**Mars Rover Project:**

One of my favourite team projects was to design and manufacture an autonomous 'Mars Rover' buggy. I was in charge of designing the suspension system on our buggy, involving performing frequency reponse analysis using Simulink. Our buggy was able to successfully navigate the test course and stop in the target zone.
