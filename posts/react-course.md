I have completed the **Learn React** course on Scrimba as part of my ongoing development as a software engineer!

The course enabled me to learn the fundamentals of React through completing several mini-projects, including a markdown notes app linked to a Firebase schema, a meme generator that fetches meme images from an API and an interactive desktop game 'Tenzies'.
