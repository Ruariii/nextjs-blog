In the ever-evolving world of sports science, understanding the nuances of human movement is a pivotal endeavor. In my work at Lucid, I have been involved in developing an isometric strength testing platform. The project involved the analysis of running gait kinematics using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors â€“ a modern technological marvel that tracks and records motion with precision.

I designed and conducted a sprint test, complete with four strategically positioned IMUs on lower limb segments. The data obtained from this setup was processed using Python, using SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas to unravel the intricacies of human movement in action.

The results were illuminating. By scrutinising the data recorded by the IMUs, we gained valuable insight into the running strategies employed by test subject. This data wasn't just about analysing running for its own sake; the overarching goal was to establish a connection between these real-world running metrics and performance on the isometric strength assessment platform.

This project showcases the exciting fusion of sports, technology, and data analysis. It's a testament to the power of interdisciplinary exploration and the potential for enhancing athletic performance through a deeper understanding of human movement. The future of sports science is undoubtedly as thrilling as it is data-driven, with each research project propelling us further into uncharted territory.
